        Hey I'm Gawusu - a <span class="text-teal-700">fullstack</span> engineer
        with experience of crafting innovative web projects.
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a versatile full-stack engineer proficient in React, Vue, Angular,
        Node.js, and Express, I possess a strong foundation in building dynamic
        and user-centric applications. My experience spans diverse domains,
        including HR management systems, fintech solutions, and real estate
        platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™ve contributed significantly to projects such as HRMS, where I
        developed robust tools for hiring, assessments, and employee management.
        At Kreditafrica, I played a key role in creating innovative
        credit-related solutions, and at Ownkey, a real estate marketplace.
      </p>

      <p>
        My latest venture, Mypurplepay, involved developing a comprehensive
        platform for managing savings, thrift communities, and loans.
      </p>

      <p>
        These projects have honed my ability to architect and implement complex
        systems while delivering exceptional user experiences. I am eager to
        leverage my skills to tackle complex challenges and create impactful
        solutions that address generational problems.
